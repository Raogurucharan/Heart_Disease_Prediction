# Heart_Disease_Prediction

INTRODUCTION:
--------------
We have a data which classified if patients have heart disease or not according to features in it. We will try to use this data to create a model which tries predict if a patient has this disease or not. We will use logistic regression (classification) algorithm,
-> Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm
->K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Classification
->Decision Tree Algorithm
-> Random Forest Classification
And create Confusion Matrix for Above.
